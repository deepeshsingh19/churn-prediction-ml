1. **Install Flask and TensorFlow:**
   - Use `pip install Flask` for Flask.
   - Use `python3 -m pip install tensorflow` for TensorFlow.

2. **Organize Files:**
   - Store all relevant files, including the trained model and Flask web application files, in one folder for easy access.

3. **Create a Pickle File:**
   - Run the `model.ipynb` file to train and save the churn prediction model.

4. **Run the Flask App:**
   - Execute `app.py` to launch the Flask web interface.

5. **Access the Web Interface:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the web interface.

6. **Input Data:**
   - Enter data for prediction using 1 for Male, 0 for Female, and 1 for Yes, 0 for No as instructed.

7. **Predict Churn:**
   - Utilize the web interface to make churn predictions based on the entered data.

This sequence of steps provides a user-friendly way to interact with the churn prediction model and gain insights into whether a customer is likely to churn (1) or not (0). It enables businesses to take proactive actions to retain customers effectively.
